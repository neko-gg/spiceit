# Changelog

Just like the cool kids, SpiceIt uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).  
Moreover, just like a ~~fellow degenerate~~ man of culture would, every minor release gets the name, in alphabetical order, of the _best girl_ I could think of at the time.

## [0.1](https://github.com/neko-gg/spiceit/tree/v0.1) - Azusa Nakano
